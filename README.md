Blossom is a exploiting tool for Roblox. Its main purpose is to inject scripts into games and give users the ability to exploit. use this tool at your own risk as Roblox will look out for these kinds of behavior and may impose punishment on users that break their terms of service. So please do it with caution and know what you’re going to get into.

## About This Executor

> [!NOTE]
> There isn't much that makes this special like others, but Solara is has backdoors so don't use that.

Blossom Executor is a personal project that im doing for fun and learning to program which this is a solo project and I am not looking to get more developers. It’s an experiment to see how far ive went with coding, and it’s a great way to get to know software development, in the case of bugs.

## Release Date

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Since im just one developer working on this, it may take longer since i only know lua and Only Roblox Lua.

Blossom Executor should be out around end of 2025. im a student and so I don’t have time to really work much in this project. Trying to fit school work and coding into my life means it is not always going as quickly as I would like. I procrastinate, but I’m trying to finish this project once school ends.
