# Blossom Executor

> [!CAUTION]
> This can and will get you banned. Use at your own risk.

Blossom is a powerful executable tool for Roblox. Its main purpose is to inject scripts into Roblox games and give users the ability to customize their gameplay experience. However, use this tool at your own risk as Roblox will look out for these kinds of behavior and may impose punishment on users that break their terms of service. So please do it with caution and know what you’re going to get into.

## About This Executor

Blossom Executor is a personal project that I’m building for fun and learning to program which this is a solo project and I am not looking to get more developers. It’s an experiment to see how far ive went with coding, and it’s a great way to get to know software development, in the case of bugs.

## Release Date

Blossom Executor should be out around end of 2025. I’m a student and so I don’t have time to really work much in this project. Trying to fit school work and coding into my life means it is not always going as quickly as I would like. I procrastinate, but I’m trying to finish this project once school ends.
