# Blossom Executor

Blossom is a powerful executable tool for Roblox. Its main purpose is to inject scripts into Roblox games and give users the ability to customize their gameplay experience. However, use this tool at your own risk as Roblox will look out for these kinds of behavior and may impose punishment on users that break their terms of service. So please do it with caution and know what you’re going to get into.

## About This Executor

Blossom Executor is a personal project that I’m building for fun and learning to program. Disclaimer: this is a solo project and I am not currently looking to scale up the team or work with others. I hope to build something that is indicative of me and my vision even if it’s just for myself.

It’s an experiment with my coding love, and it’s a great way to get to know software development, in the case of game updates. At every step of development, I’ll try to get input from the community and keep improving the software so it runs smooth and fun for anyone who does use it.

## Release Date

Blossom Executor should be out around end of 2025. I’m a busy student and so I don’t have time to really invest in this project. Trying to fit school work and coding into my life means it is not always going as quickly as I would like. I have the procrastination gene, but I’m committed to finishing this project when I’m ready.
